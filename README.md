# PasswordTester
A simple password manager to show C# best practices

Some quick notes:

* Only public classes, methods and properties are fully commented (.NET standard XML format)
* Private elements are commented when really needed, mostly in a single line
* Methods and properties in interfaces are commented on declaration, but the implementation is not commented as that would be redundant (but all members from the interface in implementation are enclosed between special tags)
